This is intended to assist with our Magic the Gathering EDH Draft league. While our rules don't completely align, [this](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/32810_The-Commander-League-Rotisserie-Draft.html) is a good primer on the process.

Running this project is simple, just pull down the source code, and run 

```
npm install
```

```
npm start
```

There will soon be a backend portion to this, and it will likely be with a simple json server npm package. But for now it's all frontend.
